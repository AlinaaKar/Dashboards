### Description

Based on data on various unicorn startups collected from public sources, I grouped the data by characteristics of origin, year of creation, size of investment, company valuation, industry, and ROI. This helped me determine which companies had the highest ROI, which industries they were in, and which locations they were discovered in. Dashboard filters can help answer other questions as well.

#### As part of the assignment, the main questions to be answered by the dashboard were voiced: 

Determined which companies have the highest ROI (return on investment) - **companies from the Others sector**. 

Determined how long it usually takes for a company to become a unicorn - **about 7 years**.

Determined which countries have the most unicorn companies - **North America, and the most popular city is San Francisco**.

Determined which investor company has invested the most in unicorn companies - **it's Accel, and it has invested in 65 companies**.
